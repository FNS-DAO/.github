# FNS DAO Announcement

Create a decentralized personal portal and DID system for Web3 users based on FVM.
## Why FNS matters
Filecoin Name Service (FNS) is an important infrastructure of Filecoin. There are a large number of addresses, miners, deals, and sectors stored on the Filecoin blockchain. FNS can give these data human-readable tags to help users better understand and access them. In addition, FNS can enable richer types of applications, such as DID and file systems, helping better establish the ecosystem.

We started the development of FNS last year and won two Hackathon prizes. The first prize was in Hack FEVM in November last year. We developed an [MVP version of FNS](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fns-filecoin-naming-service-czomc), including domain name search, registration, and resolution. The second prize was in FVM Space Warp from January to February this year. We developed an [alpha version](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fns-lookup-integrated-fns-in-filfox-explorer-7v9jy) with some improvements like optimizations in UX, resolution from domain names to CIDs, and display of domain names on the explorer. You can go to [fns.space](https://fns.space/) to experience it.

It can be seen from the community and Hackathon that many people are interested in FNS and have released their own development results. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we think people should work together to develop a unified solution to FNS. Therefore, we plan to completely open-source our code and invite all developers to make more improvements to it. Furthermore, in order to follow the decentralization spirit of blockchain, ***FNS should be running on the Filecoin mainnet as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) driven project.*** Thus, its future development will follow the real needs and vision of the community.

## What is FNS DAO
Therefore, we announce FNS DAO, inviting the community to develop and govern FNS together. The DAOâ€™s responsibility is to reach agreements on the future work of FNS through proposals and voting. In the beginning, the DAOâ€™s main task is to host testnet activities and launch FNS on the mainnet. In the future, DAO will jointly decide the development of new functions, the spending of domain registration fees, and even the airdrop of governance tokens.

The initial members of DAO will be composed of those who contributed to FNS during the past two Hackathons. Next, we will publish tasks for the testnet and mainnet as soon as possible, such as documentation and testing, and accept more members according to the completion of these tasks. At the same time, we will also take the initiative to invite some important participants in the Filecoin ecosystem, such as explorers and wallets, to join the DAO.

People who join FNS DAO before mainnet will be regarded as ***Early Contributors*** to FNS. They will grow together with FNS and enjoy some benefits in the future. Among them, those who make major contributions will be ***Core Contributors***. They will have the same governance authority as initial members and be responsible for operating the project for a long time.
